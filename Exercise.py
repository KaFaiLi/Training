# here are some suggestions to improve the code:

# - Add input validation to prevent malicious input from being processed by the server. You can use a library like flask-wtf to validate user input and sanitize it before processing.

# - Implement error handling to provide meaningful error messages to the user in case of errors. You can use the @app.errorhandler() decorator to handle exceptions and return an error response.
